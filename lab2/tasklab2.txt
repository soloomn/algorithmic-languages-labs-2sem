2.11 Develop a String2 class to work with strings. The class should contain a main constructor and a copy constructor.
Define member functions in this class that provide input/output of class elements, as well as access to private class members.
In addition, define a member function that creates a third string based on two strings, which is a concatenation of the original strings.
